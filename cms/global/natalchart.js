Although the sign of Virgo has evolved with the times, there are some unmistakable traits that remain. Virgo people are generally respectable, hard-working individuals who have a love of knowledge and know-how.Virgo’s symbol, the Virgin, shows itself in the lives of Virgos through a love of all that is “natural” and a certain purity of spirit that keeps Virgos self-sufficient and self-contained, at least on the surface. Virgos are sensitive to their surroundings, and they tend to embarrass easily. They are generally reticent when faced with anything or anyone new. However, once they feel comfortable, they can talk up a storm. Many Virgo Suns are not too comfortable in the limelight. These types are just fine living in the background, as long as they feel useful and appreciated. Solar Virgos have a strong sense of responsibility. Even when they’ve convinced themselves to be irresponsible about something or the other, they worry about it.\n\nNot all Virgos are workaholics. However, when Solar Virgos are not involved in some kind of project, there is generally a vague feeling of discontent. Even when their lives are filled up with work, they are restless and somewhat nervous creatures. The fear of under-performing is often strong. Virgos want to do things well. Some are exacting and thorough, and those Virgos who have convinced themselves to do a less-than-perfect job will generally feel incomplete.\n\nVirgo, as an Earth sign, has a notable connection to the body. Solar Virgos are generally very body-aware. In some cases, this shows up as some form of hypochondria, but, for the most part, Virgo is simply quite concerned with health matters and nutrition. Virgo is attracted to all that is natural and pure, but is generally unafraid to explore all that is not. In fact, Virgo is an intensely curious sign. Still, there is a strong desire to remain pure on some level, despite all of Virgo’s curiosity and drive to know things. Those Virgos that find a true interest or “calling” easily become connoisseurs–their attention to details and enormous observation powers give them the ability to learn all of the ins and outs of any subject. These people love to do research, in addition to analytic or detail work. They’ll happily pick apart practically anything, although they are less adept at putting things back together, and often have trouble grasping the big picture.\n\nVirgo Suns who are stuck in the practical, material world may learn a lot about themselves if they are brave enough to try placing their lives on automatic pilot once in a while. Letting some things go will do wonders for their spirit. Virgos tend to be too hard on themselves. They worry about their health, their performance at work, all the things they haven’t done, and the emails that might be waiting for them while they are away from their computer. When they’re not feeling well, they can be overly critical and nervous. They fuss around, have a whole slew of assorted little complaints, and throw small tantrums.\n\nSolar Virgos are perfectionists–there’s simply no escaping it. They dream of mastery; they long to do something really well. Some  Virgos are so scared of their own perfectionist qualities that they tell themselves they don’t care. Others will forever dabble into one thing or another, leaving a string of incomplete projects behind them. However, the happiest Virgos accept their need to get things right, without overdoing it. Probably the best advice for Sun in Virgo people is to find something that interests them–however small or large–and master it.\n\nMost Virgos can be rather private and fussy about their work, or their personal workspace. They get nervous when others look at their unfinished work, and they are quite protective of their methods of doing things. Despite an overall lack of confidence, Virgos can be mighty proud–even arrogant–when it comes to their work, routines, or hobbies. Secretly, they think their methods of doing things are the best. Often, they are! They do take pride in the little things they do, even though, in a broader sense, Virgos can be rather self-effacing and self-critical.\n\nSolar Virgos often confuse people when their curiosity is mistaken for passion. The surprising part is that Virgo, although knowledgeable, doesn’t always get its hands dirty. Their willingness to explore is often kept at the intellectual level. However, Virgos are often well-respected and valued in their circles for their loyalty, research skills, willingness to lend a hand, and their excellent powers of observation. They are generally kind and helpful souls who, when appreciated, do everything to make things work.\n\nThere’s an odd combination of the intellectual and the practical in Virgo that is sometimes mistaken for coolness. In fact, Virgos are often self-effacing and shy. They’ll brush off your compliments quickly and, sometimes, critically; but don’t let that fool you. They need your respect and appreciation. In fact, the happiest Virgos are the ones who feel appreciated and useful. Add plenty of worthwhile projects to keep them busy, and Virgos can be some of the sweetest, kindest people around.',

Generally quite eager to cooperate, Librans spend a lot of their time trying not to rock the boat.\n\nIn theory, Libras are peace-loving. In practice, they can quietly stir up all sorts of trouble with their ways. Because Libra enjoys balance in their lives, they seek the middle ground. In the process, they may end up trying to be everything to everyone. This is where their reputation for untruthfulness comes from. Generally, their untruths spring from a true desire for peace and fairness–although they may not be comfortable with direct and malicious trickery, they feel totally justified when they lie in order to avoid making waves. Peace at any price! In this sense, they seem harmless. But, what can result is quite a ruckus! People involved with Libras may crib about their lack of directness and their apparent inability to take a stand. Librans are experts at avoiding being the one to blame. When confronted, they’ll (calmly and reasonably) say, “What, me? No, I just want peace.”\n\n“On the fence”, “middle ground”, “middle road” — these are all expressions that we can safely associate with Libra.\n\nSome more powerful signs may consider Libra a little on the weak side. This is all a matter of opinion, however! Without Libra, life simply wouldn’t be as fair.\n\nLibrans are known for comparing and thinking in relative terms, instead of in absolutes.

Generally quite eager to cooperate, Librans spend a lot of their time trying not to rock the boat.</p>\n<p>In theory, Libras are peace-loving. In practice, they can quietly stir up all sorts of trouble with their ways. Because Libra enjoys balance in their lives, they seek the middle ground. In the process, they may end up trying to be everything to everyone. This is where their reputation for untruthfulness comes from. Generally, their untruths spring from a true desire for peace and fairness–although they may not be comfortable with direct and malicious trickery, they feel totally justified when they lie in order to avoid making waves. Peace at any price! In this sense, they seem harmless. But, what can result is quite a ruckus! People involved with Libras may crib about their lack of directness and their apparent inability to take a stand. Librans are experts at avoiding being the one to blame. When confronted, they’ll (calmly and reasonably) say, “What, me? No, I just want peace.”</p>\n<p>“On the fence”, “middle ground”, “middle road” — these are all expressions that we can safely associate with Libra.</p>\n<p>Some more powerful signs may consider Libra a little on the weak side.

This gives Pisces Suns the ability to identify with people from all walks of life–from all backgrounds–in some way. These individuals are not only changeable and adaptable, they have open minds and tremendous understanding. But Pisces itself is often misunderstood. Pisces Suns may spend a good portion of their lives yearning for understanding, and the other part in a state of divine discontent. Suffering is sometimes glamorized in the Piscean world.\n\nSun in Pisces people are frequently pegged as wishy-washy, but this is all a matter of opinion. What you will find behind a vaguely directionless, spacey manner is a deep person with real dreams. Their dreams are more than getting that picket fence or making it up the corporate ladder. Pisces are tuned in to a higher purpose and their dreams transcend the individual. A deep love for humanity, and compassion that knows no bounds is found with this placement of the Sun.\n\nPisceans are not known to be cutthroat business types, nor are they given to throwing themselves out into the world in an aggressive manner. But make no mistake about it, Pisces can be extraordinarily successful when given the chance to express themselves. The arts, marketing, music, teaching, drama, healing arts…these are all fields in which Pisces can find expression. Their imagination, attunement to humanity, and remarkable intuition endow them with enviable gifts of insight and creativity.\n\nPisces is a sensitive sign–both sensitive to criticism and sensitive to others’ feelings. Easily touched by human suffering, at least in theory, Pisces wouldn’t hurt a fly. They believe in people, are deeply hurt by compassionless human behavior, and have a hard time saying no. Harsh realities are avoided either through escapist behavior or self-delusion; but every now and again reality does raise its ugly head, and hits Pisces over the head. This is a sad time indeed. Pisces retreats into their own world, self-pitying and giving pep talks to themselves (“I will never trust again!”). Rest assured, though, that these periods are rather short-lived and even useful. Pisces seems to derive energy from their (generally short) bouts of self-pity. They come back stronger, with a spring in their step, ready to face the world again, and just as, if not more, compassionate and trusting as they were before. Some might even wonder if Pisces finds pleasure in suffering. Sometimes this is the case, but most of the time, Pisces pulls a lot of creative energy from sadness. Pisces is the poet or artist with angst, although this trait is often more apparent with Moon in Pisces.\n\nSome find Pisces’ tendency to be late for appointments, spaced out behavior, and absent-mindedness amount to irresponsibility. Pisces would be shocked to know this, however. Who me? Pisces wonders. Irresponsible? Pisces Suns absolutely care–their love knows no bounds–but their retreats from ordinary life (whether they are as simple as daydreams or actual departures) that they so seem to need every now and again are not always understandable to no-nonsense signs, such as Virgo or Aries.\n\nMany Pisces seem almost allergic to things like shopping lists, maps, directions, and instructions, and for some brave souls, even watches — they prefer to feel their way through life than to follow some plan.\n\nWe find plenty of artists, poets, and musicians with Sun (and other personal planets) in Pisces. Piscean themes are woven throughout the songs of Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, for example.',

People with Moon in Gemini are always interesting people–they have a finger in every pie, are curious to a fault, and are generally well-informed.\n\nNervousness and worry are common traits with this lunar position. An underlying restlessness is common, and many Lunar Geminis need more stimulation than others. They usually read a lot, talk a lot, and think a lot with this airy, mutable position of the Moon.\n\nTheir homes are often a perpetual work-in-progress. They generally dislike housework, but are big on home improvement. Re-organizing their homes in little–and sometimes big–ways seems to keep them happy, as Lunar Geminis are easily bored by both routine and constancy. Often, this is a reflection of their inner world–“the grass is always greener…” applies here. Inwardly, Lunar Geminis are often unsettled. Moon in Gemini parents are generally more adept at handling the intellectual needs of their children than emotional ones.

In fact, many Lunar Virgos are quite practiced at nagging and complaining. As long as they are appreciated, however, these people will help you take care of your life, too. They are at their best when they feel useful and needed. If somebody needs help, they are generally the first to jump up and take on the task.\n\nSome people with Virgo Moons are accused of being underachievers. While it may be true that Lunar Virgos can lack self-confidence, many are–quite simply–content with living “regular”, unassuming lives. They appreciate simplicity, and are often most comfortable when they’re not getting too much attention from the world at large. Lunar Virgos are easily overwhelmed by pressure and stress. They worry incessantly when there is too much to think about; and, they know their limits.\n\nArguably the worst position for a Lunar Virgo is without a steady routine or a simply satisfying job. They need to feel useful, and they best express this by helping others in little ways. They need something to call their own, and the space to do what they want to do.\n\nThe unhappy Lunar Virgos are fussy and complaining sorts. They are victims of routine and freak out when their plans are not followed. They are restless and nervous, and can’t seem to see the big picture. Probably the best remedy for these people is a job or hobby in which they can express their deep need to analyze, attend to details, and micromanage.\n\nThese people express their affection for the people they care about in little, but practical, ways. They can be a little stiff when it comes to open, gushy displays of affection. Lunar Virgos are often shy with new people. However, when they are comfortable, they are anything but shy.\n\nMore often than not, others can count on Moon in Virgo people. They are reliable and trustworthy. Above all else, Lunar Virgos are practical. Others turn to them for help and advice.\n\nIn relationships, Lunar Virgos can be self-effacing and kind.

The sign of Virgo is very body-aware, in general. If this awareness combines with a lack of self-confidence, Lunar Virgos can be too aware of the parts that make up the whole. This can lead to a tendency to be intensely self-critical. Once Lunar Virgos learn to come out of their shell, however, they can be earthy partners with a lot to give.\n\nSome of the most skeptical people are Lunar Virgos. They can’t help but poke holes when faced with others’ blind faith. Their criticism can be maddening, and their insistence on seeing the practical in anything emotional can be challenging, especially if you are the dreamy type.\n\nVirgo curiosity shows up big time with this position of the Moon. To some, it can be confusing. Lunar Virgos seem very interested in others’ problems, for example, but can be quite cool and even unsympathetic in the long run. Their advice can seem hard to more sensitive folk, yet Lunar Virgos can be surprisingly delicate when faced with others’ criticism.\n\nVirgo Moon people are generally busy and quietly happy when they have their lives under control. They aim for a simple existence, and are often quite content with very little. Many are early risers, ready to take on the day with enthusiasm.

Although rather sociable, they are often loners at heart. Many have strong egos, or at least powerful defense mechanisms, and most Lunar Aquarians will do their best to be the most unique and unusual person they can be. Their inner feeling of loneliness that they don’t quite fit in puts them on the outside, looking in.\n\nThere is a very idealistic and progressive streak in Lunar Aquarians that is admirable indeed. However, when the Moon is in Aquarius, natives often will deny the more irrational qualities of emotionssuch as jealousy, possessiveness, and fearin an effort to be “above” what they consider “pettiness”. When this goes too far, Lunar Aquarians can be emotionally blocked, distant, and detached.\n\nLunar Aquarians can be very willful, especially in childhood. With age, these natives generally learn to handle their strong needs. Their desire for independence is powerful indeed, no matter what their age. With a quiet Sun and/or Ascendant, their desire to “shock” others is not always apparent until a relationship becomes comfortable. They are generally proud of their family members, boasting just how unique they are. When their families are ultra-conservative, the boast will be that they rebelled against all of that!\n\nAlthough given to temper tantrums and willful behavior in youth, Moon in Aquarius people often grow up feeling that messy emotions are unappealing. They often pride themselves for being cool-headed, detached, and “above” what they consider the baser emotions. In the process, they can end up alienating othersand themselves. Although Lunar Aquarians can be especially adept at understanding others’ behavior and motivations, they can lose touch with their ownsimply because they have identified too strongly with what they aspire to be (and these aspirations are often super-human).\n\nThe Aquarian tendency to be humanitarian shows up powerfully in Moon in Aquarius. However, their kindness and concern for others is generally more a broad philosophy of life. With people close to them, Moon in Aquarius natives can seemingly lack compassion, as they often fully expect others to be as independent and detached as they are! In close, personal relationships, however, Lunar Aquarians generally give others a lot of personal freedom, and they will tolerate and enjoy all kinds of idiosyncrasies in people around them.\n\nMoon in Aquarius people are rarely flighty people, but they can be unreliable when it concerns the little things in life. Often, this is simply an assertion of their independence. In the long haul, however, they are rather constant, as Aquarius is a fixed sign. As long as they have their own space and the freedom to be themselves, however kooky that may be, they are trustworthy and loyal.\n\nLunar Aquarians generally make wonderful friends.

It can be difficult to know just how sensitive to criticism Lunar Aquarians are, simply because they hide it so well! When their character or behavior has been criticized, they tend to dig in their heels and keep right on doing it. They fully expect others to accept them exactly as they are, or they don’t have much use for them in their lives.\n\nThese sometimes maddeningly unpredictable people are nevertheless quite charming.

The down side with this apparent ability to break down boundaries is that these people can easily lose themselves in the suffering of others.\n\nTheir sense of humor is delightfully silly and a bit odd. These are perceptive souls who seem to be in touch with all the nuances and subtleties of human nature. Often this comes through in a strong sense of humor that is more of the receptive kind than the type of sense of humor that would make people the “life of the party”. It’s generally pretty easy to get them giggling.\n\nMoon in Pisces people may get tagged as “spaced out”, but there’s a lot more to them than meets the eye. They feel things out, and rely on their intuition. It just doesn’t feel right for them to do otherwise. Their dreaminess can mean plenty of moments of absent-mindedness. These times of oblivion can land them in all sorts of predicaments with others who can too easily misunderstand these complex souls. Without plenty of space and time to daydream, Pisces Moons easily get overloaded with life. Give them room to be alone with themselves, and they’re generally able to take on the worldeven if their style when they do so is not always conventional or understandable.\n\nGenerally considered soft-hearted and sweet, Lunar Pisceans care about others and are easily touched by human suffering. This tendency gains them the reputation as suckers for sob stories. Although this may sometimes be true, many Lunar Pisceans learn, in their lifetimes, how to discern between sincerity and manipulation. Still, they definitely do have plenty of soft corners.\n\nThere’s a delightful accepting side to Moon in Pisces that is sometimes mistaken for weakness. Pisces is the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac, and thus carries with it a little of each sign of the zodiac. As a result, they see themselves reflected in the behavior of others, giving them seemingly boundless compassion. Since the Moon represents our instinctive nature, Moon in Pisces seems to know how things feel without actual experience. For example, they may have never had sex, but seem to know all about it  even, or especially, the subtleties of it. The ones that aren’t too shy make awesome actors and actresses. This ability to empathize even in the absence of experience gives them an open mind and heart. Most long to express this through writing, music (both listening and making), poetry, and art in fact, the happiest people with this position do just that.\n\nThough some are doormats, most Pisces Moon people instinctively know when they’re due for a much-needed recharge. It’s at these times that they retreat from the world (and its harsh realities) if only to gather strength to face everything and everyone again. Solitude is important to them, but they also need people, so their retreats will usually be short-lived. Pisces Moon individuals believe; and, let’s face it, the world needs Piscean leaps of faith.',

Some of you might seem to change jobs often, forever in search of the “perfect fit” job. Acceptance that any job requires some level of routine is hard for you. You are very sensitive, and especially aware of minor health annoyances or body aches and pains. Some of you have hypochondriac symptoms. Some attempt to get out of things they don’t want to do by emphasizing health problems or even exaggerate illnesses in order to gain sympathy. At your best, however, you’re a person who always helps out and shows your affection for others in practical ways in order to help them solve problems and improve their lives.</p>\n<p>*You have a sympathetic nature and instinctively reach out to people in need of help. You also have a deeply ingrained tendency to want to improve or “fix” other people’s lives, which can be annoying to the person who has no desire to be changed or “helped” in this way. For you, affection and caring must be expressed in tangible acts or service of some kind.</p>\n',

If this is the only personal planet in Cancer in their chart, they may come across as more personal and sensitive than they actually are.\n\nNo matter how free-spirited the rest of their natal charts may be, Mercury in Cancer people can be very subjective and personal, or they opt not to talk at all. They are slow to respond at times, giving others the impression that they are deep thinkers. They probably are just that. Cancer is a meditative and reflective sign. Still, Mercury in Cancer people are much faster at forming opinions and making decisions than they appear. Because they listen so well to others, this speed is not obvious.\n\nYou can bet that Mercury in Cancer natives will remember almost anything — from their own past, to your conversation two months ago. You might notice their memory is a little skewed in the direction of emotion. The truth is, these people remember the mood surrounding all the moments they have stored in their memory. This is because they “feel you out” when you are talking to them. The words are not as important to them as the emotions behind them.\n\nCancer communicators come across as gentle, intuitive, and sentimental. Sometimes, they can appear quite defensive, as they can take things quite personally. They make you feel very warm and protected. Sometimes it is in their voice (solid yet soothing); and often it is in the message they are giving. Sometimes Cancer communicators can come across as if they are hiding something, which can get them into more trouble than they perhaps deserve.\n\nMercury in Cancer retains a lot of information, and learns best when they feel emotionally balanced. They prefer to focus their concentration on subjects, and approach problems in a step-by-step manner, “feeling out” an answer.

They can’t quite help themselves. But because they always aim to be kind and fair, they employ tact to get their message across. Mercury in Libra comes across in an unassuming manner, and handles people with care. When they find fault with others, they express it gently, consciously tending to others’ comfort levels. One accountant I know whose Mercury is in Libra feels she instinctively hones in on imbalances in her work. When her co-worker was struggling with “balancing the books”, this lady immediately saw her co-worker’s oversight.

It can be dizzying for others to observe! They simply can’t help but see the other side. This maddening characteristic leads to a strange paradox — they can end up seemingly incapable of giving a compliment without a “but”. After all, complimenting you is essentially drawing a conclusion, or forming an opinion.

This trait contributes to refined tastes.\n\nMercury in Libra is generally good at making connections with others, but remember that Libra can be a lazy sign–and for Mercury in Libra natives, this means mental laziness. This can prevent them from following up and maintaining the connections they’ve made.\n\nMercury in Libra hates to be thought of as the bad guy (or gal), and can end up trying to make too many people happy.\n\nMercury in Libra often has to turn to others for opinions when making a decision. The maddening part of it is this: Give these people an answer to their question, and they’ll probably take the other side. For example, if they are deciding between two different restaurants, and you give them an answer, they are almost sure to suddenly see the other restaurant’s merits. These natives play devil’s advocate far too often. Many times they don’t even truly believe the side they have taken–they are simply engaging in an intellectual argument.

Their ideas are generally very big, but it’s probably wise to use tact when you see all the little holes in their arguments. Remember, they mean well. These people have vision.\n\nNot always thrilled about focusing on details, Mercury in Sagittarius people prefer to expand their mental horizons through thinking and reading about larger subjects, like philosophy. Their thirst for knowledge can be insatiable, but they have little patience with dry academics or cold, hard facts. Theirs is a restless intellect. They learn best when they are given the freedom to think for themselves, when they are truly interested in the topic at hand, and when the things they’re learning are fun.\n\nEven though their definition of justice might bewilder some, Mercury in Sagittarius defends justice and freedom religiously. They generally have a whole slew of principles they follow, or at least defend in conversation, and they’ll gladly discuss them all with you.\n\nTheir optimism is both their strength and their weakness. After a conversation with these people, you’ll probably feel stimulated and invigorated. They make life a little better for their positive, optimistic outlook. But sometimes that optimism can be a little blind to reality.\n\nOrganization, too, is not a forte of Mercury in Sagittarius. Who has the time for organizing anyway? When the clutter around them gets too unbearable, they’re given to trashing or piling things instead of putting them in their rightful places. They do appreciate lots of room, or at least the illusion of space, when they’re working, studying, or thinking. So, their office might look alright at first glance. Open up a drawer or a closet, however, and you might find it’s bursting its seams.\n\nConversations with Mercury in Sagittarius are always interesting. You can’t help but admire their enthusiasm. At their worst, they take to preaching instead of conversing. This may not be intentional, and can get Mercury in Sagittarius into all kinds of trouble nonetheless. A good debate is hard for people with this position to pass up. Mercury in Sagittarius natives think they are very open-minded–and they are in spots–but they can come across as quite moralistic at times too.

A sure-fire way to get under their skin is to play mind games with them. They may not always pick up on the game-playing at first, but when they do, they won’t be amused.\n\nWhen they’re not fired up about some issue or another, these people are fun-loving.

They generally have a whole slew of principles they follow, or at least defend in conversation, and they’ll gladly discuss them all with you.</p>\n<p>Their optimism is both their strength and their weakness. After a conversation with these people, you’ll probably feel stimulated and invigorated. They make life a little better for their positive, optimistic outlook. But sometimes that optimism can be a little blind to reality.</p>\n<p>Organization, too, is not a forte of Mercury in Sagittarius. Who has the time for organizing anyway? When the clutter around them gets too unbearable, they’re given to trashing or piling things instead of putting them in their rightful places. They do appreciate lots of room, or at least the illusion of space, when they’re working, studying, or thinking. So, their office might look alright at first glance. Open up a drawer or a closet, however, and you might find it’s bursting its seams.</p>\n<p>Conversations with Mercury in Sagittarius are always interesting. You can’t help but admire their enthusiasm. At their worst, they take to preaching instead of conversing. This may not be intentional, and can get Mercury in Sagittarius into all kinds of trouble nonetheless. A good debate is hard for people with this position to pass up. Mercury in Sagittarius natives think they are very open-minded–and they are in spots–but they can come across as quite moralistic at times too. They’ll be the first to spot bias or prejudice in everyone else’s communication, but they can be a little blind to their own. They’re not always the best listeners, either, and not adept at picking up the subtleties in your conversation.</p>\n<p>Bluntness of speech is a trademark of Mercury in Sagittarius. These people get impatient with indirectness and beating around the bush. It baffles them. It may even piss them off for a while. A sure-fire way to get under their skin is to play mind games with them. They may not always pick up on the game-playing at first, but when they do, they won’t be amused.</p>\n<p>When they’re not fired up about some issue or another, these people are fun-loving. They love to laugh, and it’s usually pretty easy to get them giggling.</p>\n',

Not given to much fancy, these natives’ minds are oriented toward practical tasks.\n\nThere’s a bit of a doubting Thomas in Mercury in Capricorn people.

The reason for this is that they process, and relay, information (Mercury) in a Capricorn way.\n\nThe style of communication with this position of Mercury is generally of the no-frills variety.

You may even say their egos are a little underdeveloped when it comes to love, but they have a lot to give in return: namely, security, comfort, and care.\n\nVenus in Cancer men and women show their love by caring for you. They pay more attention to your feelings than your words, and observe you rather carefully. They want a safe, solid relationship. They can be a little moody in love, and some go so far as giving silent treatments and engaging in pouting routines to get attention from their mate. They are turned off by anything impersonal, and too much rationalizing leaves them cold. They are not afraid of emotional confrontations (even if they have a Gemini Sun and appear flighty in other areas of life). Still, these lovers are always worried they’ll be left high and dry. If you’ve hurt them, they’ll have a hard time forgetting. Every so often, they’ll retreat into themselves (not unlike a Crab), and it can be difficult to pull them out. This is when they use their extraordinary “nursing” abilities on themselves, instead of you…and you simply don’t want that!\n\nPleasing Venus in Cancer involves lots of snuggling and sentimentality. Recognize their attachments to their family and home. Help them to feel confident with you — when they are fearful of being rejected, they can resort to some frustrating tactics to find out just how loved they are.

Though really quite loyal to their partners (remember that love is THE most important thing in Leo’s life), they thrive on romantic attention. Be prepared for their displays: they will tell you about any advances made on them. Remember, they’re just showing off to you, and it’s likely harmless.

They are threatened by a relationship that appears to have settled too much, or one that’s lost its spark. They are also threatened by indifferent or impersonal behavior on your part.\n\nAlthough their needs for physical expression through sex are generally quite strong, their need for love is perhaps even stronger. It is hard for Venus in Leo people to separate love and sex, and even their most erotic fantasies are infused with love and affection. For this reason, few Venus in Leo folk would last long in a relationship that is mostly sexual. On the flip side, they may last longer in a love-only relationship in the absence of satisfying sex, but they are unlikely to feel very satisfied.\n\nPleasing Venus in Leo involves paying loads of attention to them. If you’re willing to make only one adjustment in your ways, it should be to remind Leo how wonderful they are. Respect and appreciate them, always. Put up with their childlike moments and their tall tales. They want to be seen as attractive by you, so avoid (at all costs!) putting them down in this area. They actually lose interest when they perceive the slightest loss of interest in their partner, and you can expect that any letdown will be acted out in a dramatic fashion. Remind them, in a gentle way, that your emotions count too. If you are feeling a little jealous, let them know. Remember, to Venus in Leo, your small jealousies are affirmations that you find them attractive and expect the rest of the world to as well.

The negative expression of this placement is overstating of feelings simply for the effect, as well as extravagance.\n\nVenus in Leo people may spend a lot on entertainment or sometimes just to show off!

					doc: 'Venus in Virgo people are not the flirtatious sort. Instead, their appeal lies in their dedication, their willingness to work on the relationship, and to make the relationship work in real terms. Unlike Venus in Leo, they won’t try to impress you with grand gifts or promises. Their gifts are less showy, but perhaps far more generous — gifts of devotion and attention to details about you.\n\nVenus in Virgo men and women quietly (and often slowly) make their way into your heart. They are quite sensitive in love — even insecure — and this reserved, loner-like quality is part of their appeal. They prefer to play it safe in their relationships, and they need to be confident that you like them before they make a move. They are great listeners and they make it a habit to observe and learn all of your ins and outs. Their love can be of the Kindergarten variety — they show they care by nagging or criticizing.

Their relationships are immensely important to them, and they may even feel that relationships consume them. In fact, they tend to want to be consumed by them! Although the basic drive is toward intense closeness, blind faith in their partners is extremely hard. Fears of being too vulnerable or of giving up their own power to others is strong. Scorpio is an “all or nothing” energy, and relationships tend to be somewhat of a rollercoaster ride as a result.

Let’s talk and have some fun.”</p>\n<p>Venus in Aquarius people are attracted to unconventionality, independence, and freedom as themes in their social relationships. Experimental relationships are intriguing to them. Being friends as well as lovers is important to Venus in Aquarius.</p>\n<p>They like to choose their terms when involved in a relationship, and this can be challenging for a partner, as their terms can be changeable! They may be reacting to a condition or situation of the moment, for example. With the exception of this quality, Venus in Aquarius people are some of the most unselfish people in love. They allow you freedom to be yourself, and are rarely clinging or controlling. They are easygoing in this manner because a partner can appeal to their sense of reason, and they always strive to be exceptionally fair and impartial. They are often attracted to art, furnishings, clothing, and music from ancient times as well as modern, abstract, and futuristic.</p>\n',

					doc: 'Venus in Pisces people project themselves as dreamy, soft-hearted partners. Everything about the way they flirt promises a lovely time. Theirs is an elusive charm — they are sweetly playful, a little moody, and perhaps a little irregular. They appreciate romance and poetry, and they prefer to “feel out” both you and the relationship you share, so don’t expect too much planning ahead. Their sensitivity can be a little misleading at times. Yes, they are sensitive folk, but lovers may find it maddening that this sensitivity is not only directed at them, but towards all of mankind.\n\nVenus in Pisces men and women want you to know that their love is unconditional. They are unimpressed by your status, and love and accept you for all that you are inside. They love the underdog and are attracted to wayward folks, or those in need of a little help. With their romantic view of the world, they can be unreasonably attracted to states of suffering and martyrdom, so they easily get into the role of saving someone, or being saved. Unlike Venus in Libra, which thrives on equality, Venus in Pisces is actually turned on by inequality! They can be rather confusing and hard to pin down as they feel their way through their relationships. As much as they may want to, they find it hard to commit. Many do end up committing, however, at least on the surface.\n\nPleasing Venus in Pisces involves enjoying tender moments and romantic times with them. You won’t always be able to count on them. In fact, you can be sure they will stretch the truth every once in a while. But remember they do this because they fear they might hurt you, and they can’t bear to cause you any heartache. Try to understand them, although that’s never an easy task considering the fact that they don’t always know themselves. And, truth is, some Venus in Pisces privately have a love affair going with the idea of being misunderstood. Try to put up with their apparent lack of direction in the relationship — they are so receptive and open to all possibilities that it is hard for them to commit to any one thing, idea, or even person. These intriguing partners will reward you with a love that is accepting and comes as close to unconditional as humans can get.\n\nMy Personal Ad Bio: “I will love you for you. I will accept you. Even if the rest of the world thinks you are unlovable, I will see you for what you really are.”\n\nPisces never sees the world in black-and-white terms. Rather, Pisces sees all the colors of the rainbow. With the goddess of love in Pisces, love is all-embracing, they are able to forgive and understand, they are seducible and seductive, and they show tremendous compassion to their partners. Venus in Pisces is tender and affectionate, although hard to reach nevertheless, as there is a longing for something that is hard to define and hard to satisfy. Borders and boundaries blur under Venus in Pisces. The shadow side of this position is allowing themselves to be victimized or deluded, as well as evasiveness.\n\nVenus in Pisces people are attracted to situations of giving, martyrdom, and mercy. They want very much to forgive, allow, and give unselfishly. Because this is not always possible — they are only human after all! — there can be problems with seeing a lover or a relationship accurately and with resentments for being put upon or used.\n\nIn love, Venus in Pisces gives a lot, but not everything. Most important to remember is this: it’s a mistake to assume a Venus in Pisces person is weak, but it’s also a mistake to assume Pisces is strong. They are both. The message is: don’t push them beyond their limits, because although it might appear that they have none, they do draw the line at some point. Avoid taking advantage of their good nature and willingness to make sacrifices. They see their willingness to forgive and understand as a strength, and you should too.',

You value a certain amount of self-sacrifice and a giving attitude in a partner, as you embody these traits. You can be quite mysterious to others, even if you don’t mean to be, because your romantic needs are kept hidden. Although you are quite naturally drawn to relationships that are unusual, secret, challenging, and unequal, do take the time to examine why this may be the case. Be certain that you are not, in some way, punishing yourself because you don’t feel worthy of an equal and public relationship. Because Venus represents attraction, and the twelfth house is associated with the feet, your feet may be especially attractive and/or erogenous zones!</p>\n',

They don’t have a lot of patience to wait things out. This is where the restless and adventurous nature of Sagittarius comes in. People with this position of Mars should seriously consider physical activity as the best means of anger management, if they don’t already (naturally) do so.\n\nPeople with Mars in Sagittarius generally have a number of projects going at once. They are not known for their follow-through, however! They start up new projects, however, with admirable gusto. Their vision and optimism can get in the way of completing what they start–they want to do so much, and they trash things too easily when a new idea takes hold.\n\nMost of the time, Mars in Sagittarius is playful and fun-loving. They love friendly debates, although they can go to extremes. Some take it personally when you don’t agree with them–why wouldn’t you agree, after all? Well, for one, you might (especially if you have planets in Virgo or Gemini) find plenty of holes in their arguments. The thing is, more often than not, they haven’t thought things through, yet they’re very passionate about what they believe in. Mars in Sagittarius loves to “wing it”.\n\nMars in Sagittarius people see themselves as warm-blooded folk. They are, but they sometimes run roughshod over others’ feelings during their more passionate debates. They can be blunt with people, although if they have a more tactful Mercury placement, this quality will be subdued. Their direct, blunt approach is most obvious in bed. They’re passionate lovers and are turned on by open-mindedness and good humor.

Well it is, but there are some important differences. While Sagittarius seeks to expand their mental and physical horizons in a broad sense, Gemini is mostly interested in moving about in their social circles.\n\nThese are people who love to ask questions, to move around freely, and to mingle. Definitely restless and often quick in physical expression, natives of the Gemini Ascendant exude an air of impatience even if they don’t mean it. In fact, there is a cleverness to Gemini Ascendants that can intimidate some, especially sensitive folk. Their facility with words can be a wonderful asset, although sometimes Gemini rising individuals identify too much with their mental agility and forget, in their personal interactions and communications, to nurture the people around them. A certain lack of warmth in presentation can be the result, and although this style is generally a facade, it is not immediately apparent to most. People with, for example, predominant Water signs may feel a little ill at ease with Gemini rising people (that is, before they get to know them more personally), while strong Air types more fully appreciate the fun and cleverness of these individuals.\n\nI have found two styles of presentation most common with Gemini rising people. One style is bubbly, changeable, talkative, and a little quirky. These natives are interesting and fun. They constantly explain things, whether it’s their own behavior and opinion or those of the world around them. Another distinct “style” is a rather cool and intellectual demeanor. These natives are often quite witty and clever, but they present themselves in a less cheerful and changeable way than the first group. Their observations are sharp and the overall manner is a tad brusque. No matter the style, Gemini rising natives are given to analysis and making sense of their world. Their powers of observation are well-developed, they are mentally active (more often than not, their minds are racing!), and they almost always have something bright or witty to say. It is easy for individuals with this position to get sidetracked, as their curiosity is large, their minds are quick, and their attention spans rather short!\n\nAs children, natives born with a Gemini Ascendant are often labeled as the intellectual, inquisitive, and perhaps odd child. Many feel their upbringing lacked some warmth.\n\nIn one-to-one relationships, Gemini rising people often seek a certain amount of personal freedom and space. They enjoy intellectual debates and exchanging ideas. Although they often demand a fair amount of freedom, they are often just as willing to give their partners room to breathe.',

It is easy for individuals with this position to get sidetracked, as their curiosity is large, their minds are quick, and their attention spans rather short!</p>\n<p>As children, natives born with a Gemini Ascendant are often labeled as the intellectual, inquisitive, and perhaps odd child.

						marked_doc: '<p>“Go with the flow” seems to be a Pisces rising motto. They move about the world in a vaguely directionless, gentle manner. They come across as artists and lovers of peace; but their open minds and hearts can give them a chameleon-like persona. Others are not always sure who they’ll meet from one day to the next with a Pisces rising person. Although often quiet and shy, another day may find them talkative and passionate. They are hugely impressionable, have a dreamy disposition, and project a soft-hearted personality. Pisces rising sees the world the way they want to see it at any given time, so objectivity is not necessarily a strong point.
